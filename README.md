# covid19data
The Shiny App for showing Covid-19 data over Polish regions (Voivodships). Shows that the spread of the disease is uneven. To be continued...
The app.R code should generate an interactive map where users can choose to see the 'zgony' - deaths, 'zarazeni' - 'confirmed cases', 'wyleczeni' - 'survivors'. Mazowieckie with capital in Warsaw has the highest overall number of covid-19 patients. However, one can see that when number od cases per 100k inhabitants is considered the trend among the Voivodhships is somewhat different with Dolnoslaskie taking the lead.

Please be advised that the map is still being developed and it is not meant to serve as source of knowledge for any decision making.
